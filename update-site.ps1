# GitHub Update Script (PowerShell - Recommended)
# Save this file as "update-site.ps1"

# --- INSTRUCTIONS ---
# 1. Save this code in your project's root folder (buddy-tech-dam-builder) as `update-site.ps1`.
# 2. In VS Code, open the terminal (Ctrl+`).
# 3. If your terminal is not already PowerShell, type `powershell` and press Enter.
# 4. You may need to allow scripts to run. If you get an error, run this command once:
#    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
# 5. To run the script, type `.\update-site.ps1` and press Enter.
